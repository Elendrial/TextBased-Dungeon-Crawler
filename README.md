# TextBased-Dungeon-Crawler
A WIP text based auto-generating dungeon crawler.
This is being made more for the fun of making it than to either learn anything new or to end up with an enjoyable game. It is neither extensive nor balanced in any way.
If you want to play a good text-based dungeon crawler then I suggest you look more at Rogue/Moria/Angbad etc, rather than try and play this.

However, if you want to make a text-based dungeon crawler without doing a lot of the base systems stuff yourself, then this might be a decent base for you!
If it's ever finished, that is...

TODO list:
- Add a decent floor generation system.
- Add a status effect system.
- Fix combat. It just doesn't work (also ranged combat system).
- Make things more consistent.
- Add more Entities/Items
- Check if possible to avoid casting in 'x'List without bloat.
- Print out the commands in alphabetical order.

Other notes:
- For some reason I've kinda gone over the top with making vars protected, if I've missed any getters/setters let me know!
