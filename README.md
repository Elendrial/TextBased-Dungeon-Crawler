# TextBased-Dungeon-Crawler
A WIP text based auto-generating dungeon crawler.
This is being made more for the fun of making it than to either learn anything new or to end up with an enjoyable game.
If you want to play a good textbased dungeon crawler then I suggest you look more at Rogue/Moria/Angbad etc, rather than try and play this.

However, if you want to make a textbased dungeon crawler without doing a lot of the early stuff yourself, then this might be a good base for you!
If it's ever finished, that is...

TODO list:
- Create a basic weapons system.
- Create a decent floor generation system.
- Create a basic inventory system.
- Create a status effect system.
