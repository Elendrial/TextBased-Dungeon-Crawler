# TextBased-Dungeon-Crawler
A WIP text based auto-generating dungeon crawler.
This is being made more for the fun of making it than to either learn anything new or to end up with an enjoyable game.
If you want to play a good text-based dungeon crawler then I suggest you look more at Rogue/Moria/Angbad etc, rather than try and play this.

However, if you want to make a text-based dungeon crawler without doing a lot of the base systems stuff yourself, then this might be a decent base for you!
If it's ever finished, that is...

TODO list:
- Create a decent floor generation system.
- Create a status effect system.
- Ranged combat for player.
- Make things more consistent.
- Check if possible to avoid casting in 'x'List without bloat.
